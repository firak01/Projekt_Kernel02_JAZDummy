		<div class="content">
		If you never heard of wake on lan you may ask what this utility is good
		for. Had you ever had the problem that you wanted to work with a computer in another office
		but it was powered down? Well, if the remote computer is wake on lan capable the Wake On Lan 
		Tool is your soultion. Wake on Lan (WOL) is a standart introduced by AMD. WOL capable
		computers can be powered on from any other host in the network by simply sending
		a packet to the host telling it to power on.
		<br><br>
		This utility is able to remotely switch on every wol capable host in the network
		you are currently connected to. You can select a single host or a range of hosts 
		and switch them on.
		<br><br>
		Additionally the Tools supports shutting down or restarting hosts.
		</div>

		<div class="subtitle"><a name="WOLHow">How does WOL work?</a></div>
		<div class="content">
		Every computer in a network has a DNS name (the computers name in the network), 
		an IP address (the computers address in the network) and a physical address 
		(the MAC address of the network card).
		<br><br>
		A WOL capable computer has a network interface card (NIC) that always 
		(even if the computer is powered down) listenes to the network traffic. 
		This is indicated by blinking LEDs at the back of the computer even when its powered off.
		<br><br>
		If a special network packet (a <b>magic paket</b>) is recieved the NIC looks if the 
		magic packet was send to its physical address (as the NIC does not know of the 
		computer name or IP address) and if yes it powers on the computer.
		<br><br>
		In order to use WOL you need to enable the feature in the BIOS of the destination 
		computer. Nowadays most computers come with WOL preeabled. If you think your Computer is not WOL 
		enabled consult the mainboard manual. See how to enable "Wake On Lan", "Wake on PCI" or "Wake by Network".
		<br><br>
		Some older computers (&lt;1999) may not support WOL at all.
		<br><br>
		In oder to user WOL over the Internet you will have to configure your router / VPN settings.
		The port used for sending the WOL UDP Broadcast is 7 (ECHO). Make sure that this port is routed 
		to your local subnet broadcast address. Eg: if you use a class C network route the port 7 UDP to 192.160.0.255. (You may also specify ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff as destination MAC.)
		</div>

		<div class="subtitle"><a name="UseWOLTool">Using the Wake On Lan Tool 2</a></div>
		<div class="content">
		The Wake On Lan Tool is made for everyone. Beginners, advanced users and 
		professionals. The design goals were simplicity, stability, portability 
		and functionality. To whatever usergroup you belong to, the tool is 
		designed to enable you to do what you want. <br><br>
		The WOL Tool 2 is delivered as a 7-Zip archive. To get things started you 
		at first may want to extract this archive using the free 
		<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip archiver</a> that is avaliable for 
		many plattforms. <br><br>
		After extracting the archive start the WOL Tool 2 by double clicking on
		the WOL2.exe. If you're using Mac OS or GNU/Linux you will have to use 
		WOL2.sh. If the tool does not start, please ensure that your system meets
		the <a href="#SysReq">System Requirements</a>.<br><br>
		If the tool is running you will automatically see the main window. On the 
		first run an empty file is created. Now you can use the 'New Host' button 
		to add computers manually. Alternatively you may use the 
		<a href="#UseNetScanner">build in network scanner</a>. After you have added 
		all your hosts save the file using the 'Save File' button.<br><br>
		To wake, reboot or shutdown a host or a range of hosts select them and 
		click the appropriate 'Wake', 'Reboot' or 'Shutdown' button. You may configure 
		the options for shutdown and reboot using the options dialog.<br><br>
		<b>Shutdown and reboot does currently only work on Windows machines.</b><br><br>
		You may also define a timer to let the WOL Tool 2 wake a host automatically.
		To do this choose the host from the list and click the 'Edit Timer' button
		to open the 'Edit Timer' window.<br><br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subtitle"><a name="UseGroups">Using Groups</a></div>
		<div class="content">
		The Wake On Lan Tool 2 allows you to organize your network in groups. 
		To add a new group right click on the 'All' tab in the main window. 
		From the context menu choose 'Add Group...'. In the following input
		box enter the name of your new group and click the 'Ok' button.<br><br>
		To add a host to a certain group right click it, and choose 'Add to group' 
		to add it to a certain group or 'Set group' to specify one group this 
		host belongs to. You may also define the groups in the 'Edit Host' window.
		To rename or delete a group activate it first. Then right click on the 
		appropriate tab page and select 'Rename Group...' or 'Remove Group...' 
		from the context menu. When renaming a group, the tool automatically 
		assigns all hosts that belonged to the old group to the new one.<br><br>
		Groups do also have timers to allow you to wake all computers belonging 
		to a certain group at once.
		</div>
		
		<div class="subtitle"><a name="UseNetScanner">Using the build in network scanner</a></div>
		<div class="content">
		The network scanner is a simple but efficient tool to create or 
		update host files.<br><br>
		You can start the automatic network scanner by choosing the menu action 
		'Scan for new hosts' from the 'Edit' menu.<br><br>
		It will automatically search new computers on all networks that your computer is 
		attached to. It will add computers to the currently open host file 
		if the network scanner is able to determine the MAC Address using ARP.<br><br>
		Another option is to use the Network Scanner Window you may already know
		from WOL Classic. To open the window please choose 'Open network scanner...'
		from the 'Edit' menu.<br><br>
		Please note, that the destination computers need to be turned on and 
		connected to the network in order to be found by the network scanner.<br><br>
		You may configure the scanner in the options dialog (Menu 'Edit' -&gt; 'Options').<br><br>
		The network scanner uses an ICMP ECHO request as described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/" target="_blank">RFC 792</a>.<br><br>
		<b>The scanner does currently only work on Windows machines.</b>
